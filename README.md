# bootcamp
Explain the security risks that this behavior introduces. unauthorised access to company data /back door


Describe a method for finding out how many people encourage tailgating, and keeping track of those who do. cameras using facial recognition


Set a goal for how many employees should engage in this behavior. less than 5%


Identify three potential high-level solutions to this problem, such as training or hiring guards. Note one advantage and disadvantage for each.


Set an estimated timeline for each potential solution.


Draft a plan specifing the following details:


Make an Action Plan: Identify your "plan of attack." For example, you might propose to implement a training, implement stricter security controls, or some combination of the two.


Schedule: Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: Explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.


Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs): Explain what you will measure to determine if your plan has been successful. Specify KPIs indicating what you want your plan to achieve. These are your planned goals.


Measurements: Explain how you will measure the success of your plan. Specify both when and how you'll measure results.

Be detailed. For instance, if you're going to contract a pentesting company, explain exactly what you'll have them do.



During review, you'll discuss an example solution to this problem. However, there are many good answers, so don't hesitate to be creative. Do remember to justify every decision you make.


In this activity, you will draft the final piece of recommendations submitted to GeldCorp.


You've already developed a full training plan, with target dates and a suggested delegation structure. However, training won't address the problem in the short term: It will take at least a quarter to train just 25% of the company. Improving the organization's security culture is a valuable long-term outcome, but the issue also needs to be mitigated immediately.


The training plan is a personnel security measure, and won't drastically reduce tailgating rates until at least next year.


Consider physical, technical, or procedural controls that would immediately reduce employee tailgaiting.



Instructions
Record three different controls of any type. Answer the following questions about each control:


How does this reduce tailgating?


What is the cost of implementation?


What percentage reduction in tailgaiting rates do you expect?


Note: GeldCorp is well funded. They are willing to invest in innovative solutions to the problem. Be realistic and justify your suggestions, but if, for instance, you are interested in using complex biometrics or other such systems, budget is not a concern.
Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.
